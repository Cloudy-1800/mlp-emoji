MLP-Emoji-SlackHQ
=================

I needed MLP emoji for my company's Slack. So I made them. Thanks to @SteveStreza for pointing me to [/r/mylittlepony/](www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/).

**How to install:** Reference this tweet [https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/437028458627989504](https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/437028458627989504) for details on how you can add these to Slack.

I have given each icon a title that I find suitable for use in Slack. If you think it deserves a better title, or you want to add more icons to the set, please submit a pull request and we'll get it taken care of.
